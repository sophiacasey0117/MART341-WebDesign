## Div (at least 2)
I used divs to group together my photographs in the 'Portfolio' page, since I wanted them all to be in a grid type layout and roughly the same size for balance. I also used a div to center an image on my 'About Me' page so I could keep my body code organized and keep the styling elements in one section.
## Span (at least 2)
I used span to highlight the text "Missoula MT" on my 'About Me' page, adding emphasis to my upbringing and backstory, as well as highlighting it to show that I'm still based there. I used another span to highlight the quote by David Shields on the 'About Me' page because that quote embodies what I want to do with my photography and the basis of my company.
## Audio (at least 1)
I embedded a song from spotify using an audio-section div. I added this section to my website to include some more personal parts about myself, that way the client/user can get a better understanding of who I am as a person and not just as a brand.
## Video (at least 1)
I used a hero video. It's a video that I took of some wheat on a walk that I took, and I am using this footage in a bigger school project as well. I think it shows how natural and local my photography is.
## Iframe (at least 1)
I used a Map Iframe at the bottom of my 'About Me' page in order to show where my photography studio/company is located in a visual format as well as having the text address.
## Class (at least 2)
I used a nav class in order to keep the style and overall look of my navigation menu/header consistent across all pages. I also used a portfolio-section class in order to structure/plan out the layout for the portfolio container where all of my photographs would live. This class applied the same styles for spacing and alignment between each photograph.
## Escape character (at least 1)
I used the Â© escape character in order to show a copyright symbol in the footer of every page on my website.
