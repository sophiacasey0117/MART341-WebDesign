# Required Techniques (Must Have):

Create a page with an external CSS style sheet

    updated my index.html file and portfolio.html
    
Add hover effects to enhance interactivity

    Hover effects added to all links: Name, 'Enter' and Social

Use an external font that is self-hosted

    Used a font called 'Lemon Tuesday', which I used for my name header

Use an external font from a font library

    Used 'Thesadith', bold, a nice modern sans-serif which I got from the Google Fonts library. Used for all text on the site besides my name.

# Three Additional Techniques:

Experiment with different font styles

    Used a handwritten font for the header for a more personalized feel, and then contrasted that with a sans-serif, modern font for the links and quote

Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc.

    Removed underlines from all links and added a border around the 'Enter' link so it would draw the attention of the user. That way they know where they need to go

Align text or elements for a clean layout

    Aligned my header text to the left, my links to the right, my quote to the bottom left and my copyright footer to the bottom right. I did this so the page would have a nice boxy feel, while also being spacious, minimalistic and simple
