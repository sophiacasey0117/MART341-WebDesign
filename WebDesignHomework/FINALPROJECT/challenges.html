<p>I go into more depth with individual challenges I've faced on the 'Projects' page. However, the main challenges I faced throughout this semester had to do with Responsive layouts. When it comes to responsive coding and design, I mainly struggle with getting my website to look good on ALL screen sizes. In Assignment 13 when we explored coding for Mobile, I was able to make the website look good on a smaller screen, but only on the specific size that I selected. When I tried to view it on a smaller screen, or one slightly bigger, everything would be off and out of place again.</p>
<p>I wonder if it would work better if I did three different sizes. One being the average laptop screen size, another being the middle value, maybe like a tablet size, and then the last being a smaller mobile size. I think then, if I selected anything in between those points, the elements should move and adapt accordingly. However, I've just done some research on how to make a website responsive to every screen size and at first it worked, but then something changed and messed it up. I'm not sure what. Whenever I loaded up a mobile screen there would be horizontal scrolling, even with all of my elements sized supposedly to the screen. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what I was doing wrong.</p>
<p>I guess the main challenge that I have within responsive layouts is correcting the positioning of my elements, specifically text and images. I learned how to code for mobile first, since sizing up is easier than sizing down. Yet, for this website, I started the opposite by designing for laptops first. I've found that it's much harder to code down to Mobile size, and still haven't figured out how to do it. So I'll be studying up on that and continue to learn about it more.</p>
