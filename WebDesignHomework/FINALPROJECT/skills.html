<!-- Transferable Skills Response -->

    <h2>Communication Skills</h2>
    <p>My communication skills have definitely improved throughout this course. I pay more attention to being detailed and thorough in my coding by giving every section titles. This helps me stay incredibly organized and makes navigating my own code a lot easier. It'll make looking at other people's code and vice versa much easier as well.</p>
    <p>Participating in peer reviews is always something I've enjoyed doing, so being involved with that part of this course has continued to help me expand my language and abilities to provide feedback to other's work. It also makes me feel more confident and excited to showcase my work!</p>        
    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    <p>Problem solving is probably the transferable skill I'll be taking with me the most. In coding, there's a LOT of problem solving. That's basically what coding is. A lot of assignments this semester have tested my patience and required me to do some outside research to figure out why something wasn't working. Instead of giving up and moving on, this class has helped me stick with it and work to find the problem. This is an incredibly helpful tool that I use for everything in life. It's important to reach out to others for help if you can't find the answer yourself. This is something I'm getting more and more comfortable with doing, and will continue to do throughout my life.</p> 
    <h2>Time Management</h2>
    <p>This is a big one. It's incredibly easy for me to get sucked into these projects, spend hours upon hours upon hours of staring at the screen trying to get it done. One, because I love designing and think it's cool that I can make something out of code. Two, because it's challenging and when something isn't working it nags at my brain to figure it out. This makes it hard to walk away, even when I know I should. This is something I'm getting better at, slowly but surely, by setting timers for myself so I can make sure I'm doing my other work with just as much passion instead of spending it all on web design. It's something I still struggle with doing, as deadlines often drive which project I work on the most. But throughout this whole semester I've managed to balance this course with 13 other credits worth of classes. I've always taken pride in my ability to manage time and get things done by the deadline, if not earlier. This course has challenged that and has made it stronger.</p>
    <h2>Creativity</h2>
    <p>I have defintely not fallen short on my creativity skills, as being creative is a huge part of who I am and what I want to do in my future. Throughout this course and as our assignments got more complex, my creativity blossomed. I enjoyed learning knew skills and tools that would allow me to do more, and eventually I landed on a website layout/design that satisfied my creative needs. It's been a lot of fun exploring web design in a creative way, and has helped me see coding as an art form rather than another language or numbers, letters, and symbols on a screen.</p>
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>One of the things I enjoyed most about this class was getting to hear from my peers and see their projects. It was super cool seeing what all they were working on as well as reading their feedback on my own website. It was incredibly helpful hearing from other people and using their advice to fix any issues I had within my site. I wish that we had been able to see others' websites earlier in the course, I think it would've been fun to see these projects evolve from start to finish.</p>
    <p>Collaboration is something I enjoy doing, but can definitely use some improving. I'm not as socially outgoing, so collaborating or even just reaching out to collaborate with someone can feel very daunting. This course has helped me feel more confident about my work and my ideas, and has made it easier talking to others in my community about either getting help on my projects or offering my help for theirs.</p>
    <h2>Attention to Detail</h2>
    <p>I've always had great attention to detail, but learning how to apply it in code and in web design is something new for me. I quickly adapted to it though and looked at it like graphic design. I move an element ever so slightly in one direction because visually it's more appealing and makes sense. I would say that paying attention to detail is one of my biggest strengths, but can also be a weakness because projects will take me a bit longer to complete.</p>
    <h2>Adaptability</h2>
    <p>Adaptability has been one of the harder things to learn with this class, and in general I guess. With tools like Bootstrap, it was incredibly hard to adapt because it felt like a whole lot of levels up from where my current skill set is and understanding of code language in CSS and HTML. When I tried to make adjustments to Bootstrap it felt basically impossible. I couldn't find elements I needed to change, so it felt like I had little to no creative control. Even though it's supposed to make responsiveness a piece of cake, I feel more comfortable without using Bootstrap.</p>
    <p>It feels like it's been hard to adapt recently with everything going on in the world, but I know that adapting is a necessary skill for survival or simply just making it to the next year. This course has helped me be more open to adapting when things aren't going my way, especially with coding. Sometimes it's better to shift my thinking and try something else rather than beating a dead horse to try to get what my original vision was. It's important to be able to do that, and I've been trying to get better at it throughout the semester, even though it's tricky.</p>
