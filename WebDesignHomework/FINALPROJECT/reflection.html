<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Process</h2>
<p>For this project, I started off with thinking about the layout and how I wanted it to be organized. I took a look at the main topics our final projects needed to reflect and decided that I was going to make each one their own page on my website, that way I could explore them fully. Next, I considered the aesthetics of the site and what I wanted it to feel like. Since this project is a 'Post Mortem' I thought that this website should embody my style as a whole and showcase the kind of sophisticated creativity that I bring to the table and have developed over this semester. I chose a font titled 'Vortigra' for headings because it felt elegant and sophisticated while having some curves and creative quirks within each character. I then chose and handwritten font titled 'Mayonice' which would give off a hand-drawn, crafty feeling, especially for the links on the homepage appearing to be part of the collage. I then found this font 'Thesadith' that I would use for paragraph text, that way it's easy to read and see.</p>
<p>After having an idea of the fonts and layout, I settled on a color scheme and assigned each color to their roles. I also decided that in order to really drive home the handmade vibe, I made the background a canvas texture so it felt like this website was a tangible piece of art. After getting all of the aesthetics in order, I started to code the physical layout of my image and text elements. I knew I wanted the homepage to feel like a collage and be fairly minimalistic with it's text. Since 'Post Mortem' is the theme/title of this project, I made that text fairly big, taking up half the page while my collage took up the other half. I thought it would be a fun idea to include the links to the other pages within the collage, so I removed the original words that were part of the collage in Procreate, that way my links could replace them. Moving on to the header, I wanted that to be pretty simple as well while also mirroring the style of the homepage. I made the name of the tab you're currently on bigger and put a border around it in order to separate it from the rest of the links. I then made the other links a bit smaller and placed them on either side of the main text, creating a balanced feel to each page. After getting that main layout, I coded a yellow block where my text responses would live for each page, that way the style stayed consistent and the overall feel of the website would be cohesive.</p>
<p>From there, I started thinking about responsive design. As stated in the other pages on this site, responsive coding is my biggest challenge. Unfortunately, this website ended up being somewhat responsive, but only for two sizes which would be the size of my laptop screen and then the size of an IPad Pro. I tried to make it responsive with my phone screen size, and I did have it all right for a moment in that media querie. But then when I made another media querie for the IPad size, everything in my Phone size got messed up and I wasn't able to make the adjustments to fix it, nothing was responding. I made sure I was in the right code section and I was, but nothing was responding. After making this website somewhat responsive, I double checked each page and detail to make sure everything was behaving as it was supposed to, and that I had no errors in my code.</p>
<h2>Reflecting on my Learning</h2>
<p>Throughout this semester, I built and refined my coding skills. I learned more about containers, downloading and using fonts from outside sourced libraries, and how to use my understanding of coding to fully explore my creative visions. At the beginning of this semester I didn't know nearly as much and because of that my creative exploring was pretty limited. I only knew how to highlight words and play with text hierarchy, and input some images. Even then, I didn't know the best way to control the sizing and positioning of these elements. Now, with the skills I've refined and built, I know how to move, scale, and re-position elements such as text and images, as well as containers or boxes where those elements might live. Before, I didn't know much about containers or how to use them to create a grid-like layout which made it easier to design and organize my material.</p>
<p>I go into a lot more detail about the transferable skills I've built on the 'Skills' page linked above. The main skills that I refined were Adaptability, Time Management, and Problem Solving.</p>
<h2>Wins and Lessons</h2> 
<p>I am so incredibly proud of how far I've come since the beginning of this semester. The dedication and time that I put into each assignment. How I explored different creative processes and aesthetics until I found one that felt like ME, and one that I could fully dive into with my portfolio project. When I create a website, I now am not afraid of what I'll be able to do creatively. I get an idea of a design, feeling, and layout, and go for it! I'm proud of myself for doing outside research in order to include elements that I really wanted to make. I'm proud of myself for perservering through problems that came up and being able to solve them.</p> 
<p>I learned a lot of lessons through those triumphs as well. I learned that sometimes it's okay to take a step back when something is giving me trouble instead of pushing myself to keep going which most often made me more frustrated and made finding the solution harder. I learned to try to take my time and remind myself to stay organized in my coding space so I don't get lost or change code that I don't intend to. I learned that it's important to give myself specific time slots where I can work on different types of school work instead of putting all of my eggs into one basket. While it's hard not to spend the whole day working on projects like these, because they're fun and challenging, it's important to take breaks and remember that there are other school projects I need to complete too. Another lesson that I'm really trying to keep in mind and listen to, is to try not to be too ambitious with my assignments, especially when I have an approaching deadline. It can be either a good thing or a bad thing to be overlly ambitious, I think it's usually a good thing because I always want to try to do my best and make something that I'm proud of. But on the other hand, it's important to be adaptable and be able to change course when my original idea doesn't end up working out. I think that's something I've gotten better at doing throughout this course, especially with this current assignment!</p>
