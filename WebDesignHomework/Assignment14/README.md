# Required Techniques (Must Have):

## 3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme. Each page must link to the others flawlessly, utilizing a user-friendly navigation.

home/enter page, about me page, portfolio page

## Framework Integration – Incorporate a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to enhance design and layout.

## Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal.

nav menu 'tabs' style used consistently on the 'about me' and 'portfolio' pages. I also used it to recreate my photo grid in the portfolio page

## HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations. Feel free to apply this to your duplicated test page.
