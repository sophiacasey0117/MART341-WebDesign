# Which Idea I'm Developing
Out of the three website ideas I thought about last week, I'm desciding to develop the Portfolio option further. 

I think it would be a good idea to experiment more in that category since I'm going to be putting together a professional portfolio at the end of this semester of all my photography work!

# Reflection

I applied the balance concepts we've discussed to my website by making everything center-aligned as well as using both assymetrical and symmetrical balance. It made the overall page's design feel intentional and well organized, which reflects who I am as a person and my brand (well organized and neutral). Adding onto that, I changed the background color to a light beige/off-white in order to make the whole page feel calm, neutral, and relaxed. 

At first, I wanted my introduction section to be at the top of the page, with my profile picture floating to the right and my introduction text on the left of it. However, I was having trouble with keeping these elements in their places while being reactive whenever I changed the size of the window. Like, the text would wrap weirdly and things just wouldn't look organized. I ended up having to start over my code because there were some problems I just couldn't fix OR find where the problem was, so I ended up going with a more straightforward layout to begin with instead of trying to focus too much on a 'final draft'. 

I did experiment with float and margin. Margins were easy to adjust and understand, float went the same except for in my first layout attempt where the float was messing with the layout of my text that was next to it. But I was able to figure it out and fix it in my second attempt!

When it came to using CSS I didn't really have any issues. With the ones that I did have, or the moments where I was confused about what was happening, it's because I accidentally named a class that was meant for an entirely different element/tag. So things just got a little mixed up there, but once I figured that out I got it more organized and didn't have issues after that.

Personally, I'm doing good! I've been actually enjoying coding websites and things like that this time around compared to when I took Creative Coding 1. This teaching method is working way better for me and it's allowing me to actually be passionate and have fun with what I'm making in this class.
