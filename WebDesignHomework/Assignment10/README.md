# How did the peer review go for the discussion? Was it easier to remember to post and reply in this format?
The peer review went very well. For me it's easy to remember to post and reply anyway, but it was helpful that other people had already responded to the discussion so I could replay right away!
# README List:
## 1. Designate which page you're working on: 

    index.html and portfolio.html

## 2. Required Techniques:
### - Create a page with an external CSS style sheet:

    portfolio.html and index.html

### - Use at least 1 class selector: 

    class container, headerp, enter, ig

### - Use at least 1 ID selector:

    Used in my personal quote on my Homepage
    
## 3. Select at Least Three Additional techniques:
### - Positioning

    I applied display, padding, and margin in order to establish a consisten grid layout across all pages

### - Opacity

    In headers for both pages, my name and nav links are set to different opacities. Their original set opacity is 90%. I also made it so that when the cursor hovers over the link the opacity decreases to 80%
### - Text Alignment

    I oriented my text for my header so that my name was positioned on the left and my other links are positioned on the right. This way the page still feels center balanced even though my main navigation links are not directly in the center. I also oriented it this way to work with my Hero Image on the home page. I wanted all of the header to still be visible while also keeping the main page in a minimalistic aesthetic. I think the text alignment played a huge part in that, as the space feels used up in a nice, even way while also being bold and complimenting the site's aesthetic
