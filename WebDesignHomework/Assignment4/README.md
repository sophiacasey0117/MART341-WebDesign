## What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages?

- DOM is an interface to a document and records how that document is accessed and changed by having a logical structure: representing these documents as nodes and objects on a tree-like structure so that programming languages can modify content without having to reload the page. 

## HTML, XML, XHTML - what sets them apart?

1. **HTML** - functions as the foundation and structure of a page's content. After the page is made, other aspetcs such as stylesheets or scripts can be embedded or attached to that page. Displays document nodes.
2. **XML** - describes document nodes. It's major use is in technologies like those utilized by Gmail that allow specific elements to update without having to refresh the entire page.
3. **XHTML** - acts as a bridge between XML and HTML by combining the best of both in an attempt to correct some errors/lenient behaviors of HTML.
