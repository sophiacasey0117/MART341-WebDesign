## Instructions

### Step 1: Get Screenwriting Software
Screenwriting software will make writing 1 million times easier and quicker. You can definitely hand-write your short film or even your feature if you prefer that method, however I find it a lot easier and less physically taxing on my hands to type it up. Now, why not use Google Docs or Word? Because there is <b>NO</b> built in formatting with set margins and styling.

Software like FadeIn will evenly space out certain elements, such as your Dialogue, Transitions, and Scene Headings, every single time. This way, you don't have to memorize the amount of spaces or TAB overs whenever you make a new section. It's just an easier, more efficient tool that I highly recommend.

### Step 2: Brainstorm Ideas!
It may take a while to come up with one that strikes you and pulls you in enough to make you want to write a whole script, but this is where you get to let your personal voice, style, and stories to thrive.

Remember, it's okay to keep it simple or small! Try not to think out the whole story all at once. Start with a person, or a place, or a memory/event that is personal to you. There are many different methods of brainstorming, it's important to find the one that works for YOU!

<b style="color: #f6ce88;">"WHATEVER WORKS"</b> is the most important takeaway I got out of my screenwriting course. It means that while there are certain opinions, formats, and "rules" YOU are still the writer and it's YOUR movie. Do whatever works for you and the story. Art is subjective, that includes writing and every project you'll ever create.

### Step 3: Develop Your Characters
Your characters ARE the story. They are what drives the themes and message, they are the reason people watch or listen. Deep diving into your main characters, and even your side characters, will immediately add a lot more depth to your story and allow you to write your story with a deeper understanding of it. You will go from having a rough, surface level idea for characters and the plot to making this story and these people REAL.

Ask your characters questions that you would ask someone you're meeting for the first time, because that's what's happening! You're getting to know your characters through a conversation, answering in their voice and with their experiences. They are not imaginary, treat them as real physical beings.

#### Starting with questions like:
How old are you?
What is your current occupation?
Do you have any siblings?

#### And moving into questions like:
Do you have a good relationship with your parents?
What is a memory you look back on fondly from your childhood?
What is it you want and need the most?

Asking these questions and answering them in the voice of your character will give them a body and a life. You start to understand them from the inside out, and no matter what situation they find themselves in you will be able to write them in respect to their character and how they would react.

### Step 4: Create an Outline
Now is the time for you to create an outline for how you envision your story playing out. This is an OPTIONAL step. As with everything in this list, the method and way you go about writing your story depends on what process works for you. This is my personal method.

Creating an outline will help keep your ideas in order, get your started on the writing process, and allow you to easily come back and fill out the story in a more detailed way. It also makes it easier to go back and make changes to your story before you go all in on elaborating plot points.

### Step 5: Write a First Draft
You've made it to the first draft! Woo! Keep in mind, it doesn't have to be perfect the first write-through. Force yourself to not look back and change things as you write. Keep going until the end, then take a step back and save the revisions and changes for the second draft.

It's also a good idea to have other people who have not heard your idea/story read the first draft. That way you can get genuine feedback, see how it's receieved and if there is any confusion. It can be hard and uncomfortable to have other people read your work, especially when it's a first draft, but it is a vital step to improving your work and getting your point/message across in a way that will be clear and successful.

Keep in mind as well that you don't need to apply every little suggestion people give you. Take what resonates and leave the rest!

### Step 6: Take a Step Back
Take a break! It's important to remember to take care of yourself. Writing and doing character work, the entire creative process can be very tiring and mentally exhausting. Taking a break is vital in making sure you don't burn out, it refreshes your mind and also your eyes. It's easier to make changes and continue writing when you have a fresh mindset instead of a tired, overworked brain.

So go outside, hangout with friends, listen to music. Do whatever you do to relax. And when you're ready to look at it again and have another crack at it, you'll be awake, refreshed, and doing so won't burn you out.

### Step 7: Rewrite
Now that you've taken a break, you're ready to begin rewriting! This is the part where you get to make all the changes you've thought about making and (hopefully) haven't made them until now! With rewrites, I recommend copying the original text over to another document, that way you still have the original to reference or look back on, and you're still able to make changes without permanently losing your original version. Or you could have the original open to the side of your new document as you're rewriting, depends on your preference!

Focus on small sections at a time, try not to get overwhelmed with rewriting the entire thing. And also keep in mind that you don't NEED to rewrite all of it. Using the feedback you've gotten from others and the parts you want to change, and keep that in mind as you write your second draft.

### Step 8: Complete Your Final Draft
You're finishing your script! Making those final touches, final changes, bringing it all together. You might go through a couple of drafts before you get to this step, if so then repeat the last two steps until the story is where you want it! After you've finished you script, share it with those around you! If you want it to be brought to life, ask friends, teachers or anyone who might have the resources to do so. If you're currently in college, go to the film department and see who's interested, because film students are always looking for projects to build their reels.

## Closing and Additional Tips
Remember, this is YOUR project and ultimately YOUR decisions. You don't have to follow this step by step if it doesn't work for your creative process.

Remember, do whatever works for your story. You don't have to take everyone's suggestions and you don't need to obey the 'rules' of screenwriting such as keeping descriptions short, avoiding adjectives, and other formatting specifics.
