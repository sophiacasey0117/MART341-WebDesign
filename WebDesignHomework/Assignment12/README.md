# Working on *homepage.html* (The home page for my Assignment 11 Website)

## Select at least 6 of the following techniques to implement:


### Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.

Used width=100% and height=auto for the container, controlling the size of all elements on the webpage so it fits the full screen.

### Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.

Used border for my blockquote and 'ENTER' menu link.

### Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.

Set margin-top and margin-bottom for all elements on the website.

### Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.

Set padding for each element, as well as within the text that has a border around it so it would have a cohesive, balanced feel.

### Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.

Used 'inline' for social media link so it would be positioned next to the ENTER link. Used inline-block for the ENTER link, keeping everything in that header navigation on the same plane, everything spaced evenly and when you change the size of the window it stays in that line.

### Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.

Used position for headers, containers, links and blockquote. Used position absolute for all elements except the container, for which I used 'relative', that way it would be easier to adjust or move if needed to.
