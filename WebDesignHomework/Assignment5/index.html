<h1>Three Website Ideas I Want to Explore</h1>

<!-- Portfolio Section-->
<h2 id="portfolio">1. Portfolio</h2>

<p> For my portfolio website I would want the tone to be playful as well as calm. Right now, I'm working on putting together a photography portfolio and the tone is overall classic, warm, welcoming, and calm. However, I'm not sure if that's authentic to my style and my person. I'm still trying to figure out exactly who I am. I like playful and fun but I also enjoy my calm moments.</p>
<p>A little bit of both maybe.</p>

<!-- Personal Blog Section-->
<h2 id="personal-blog">2. Personal Blog</h2>
    <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_1cd93184350f476e853c8b6c3d89c360~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_924,h_555,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/6542d9_1cd93184350f476e853c8b6c3d89c360~mv2.jpg" width="530">
<p> For a personal blog type of website, I feel like it's in the same boat with my photography portfolio. I would want it to feel authentic to me and represent what I'm all about. So I think a controlled playfulness would be the correct tone.</p>
<p> I would want for there to be lots of pictures, graphics, fun colors and things like that while still having a controlled and organized UI.</p>

<!-- Travel Journal Section-->
<h2 id="travel-journal">3. Travel Journal</h2>
    <img src="https://assets.bucketlistly.blog/sites/5adf778b6eabcc00190b75b1/assets/64608f6f165ece00029fce5a/saltinourhair-main-image.jpg" width="530">
<p> As for a travel journal, I imagine mine having that scrapbooking type of feel/texture to it. More handwritten fonts, 'taped' down pictures, kind of a controlled mess is what I picture.</p>
<p> I would want it to feel more real and tangible than digital. I think travelling and collecting the memories from those travels should be in more of a tacticle medium, so I would try to make my website feel as real and scrapbook-y as possible. </p>
