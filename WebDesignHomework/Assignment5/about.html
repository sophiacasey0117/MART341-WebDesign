<h1> Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>

<!--Portfolio-->
<h2 id="why-portfolio">1. Portfolio</h2>
<p>I want to create a photography portfolio so I have something to show clients or employers what I have done in the future when I'm trying to get hired and into a more professional work environment. I also think it would be a nice place to keep all of my work. It would be more organized <strong>AND</strong> stylized.</p>
<p>I hope to find out more about myself, my personal style/branding and what I represent through this process of trying to create my own portfolio.</p>

<!--Personal Blog-->
<h2 id="why-blog">2. Personal Blog</h2>
<p>I think a personal blog would be interesting to develop and work on as a way to track my experiences, my health (mental and physical), as well as to keep a digital trail of my life. In this personal blog, I would treat it kind of like a bullet journal. I would track my moods, do diary entries, and store memories or moments from that day that stuck out to me.</p>
<p>I see using this personal blog as a way to stay in touch with myself and <strong>MY</strong> needs. A way to keep myself on track and stay organized in my head.</p>

<!--Travel Journal-->
<h2 id="why-travel">3. Travel Journal</h2>
<p>A travel journal would be a fun way to collect memories and save my thoughts on the places I went and experiences I had. I think it would be really cool to have this digital journal appear like a real one. Where you can bookmark different placea I would travel, flip between pages, and for each section it would be a continuous vertical flow of memories.</p>
<p>I currently keep a physical travel/adventure book that I have been printing pictures into and writing little notes about it. I think it would be awesome to be able to just upload pictures to the website and not have to spend a lot on film. Plus, I would always move things around on the website or change up the feel of it, whereas with a physical book I'm more limited to what I can modify.</p>
